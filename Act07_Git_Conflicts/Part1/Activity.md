# Activity 7, Part 1: Merge

1. Project.zip contains a git repository. Unzip it.

2. Draw a diagram of the commits and branches in Project.

    - Use `git branch` to list the branches in this repository.
    - Use `git checkout` to explore each branch.
    - Use `git log --decorate` to explore the structure of commits.

    ```













    ```

3. Use `git diff COMMIT_OR_BRANCH` to view the changes since a commit or branch.
   Summarize what has changed on each branch.

    ```













    ```

4. Write a command sequence to merge the non-master branch into `master`

    ```











    ```

5. Execute your sequence. Then explore and draw a diagram of the new state of your repository.

    ```











    ```

6. Did your merge sequence work as expected?

    ```











    ```
