Chris Beams' [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/): https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

## Instructions

1. Read the introduction
2. Read the list of "The seven rules of a great Git commit message"
3. Review the example template of a commit message (just below the 7 rules).

## Questions

1. Which rule or rules does the following commit message violate:
	```
	I moved foo() and bar() from class A to B

	After I moved these methods, I reran the tests. All
	tests passed. So we're good.
	```

```








```

2. Rewrite the commit message above. You may make any assumption about the context.

```












```


3. What is the goal of a commit message?

```






```


4. Browes through the commit messages of the repositories linked to in the article.
   Find an example of a good commit message (with a body), and a bad commit message
   (with or without a body).

```
















```
