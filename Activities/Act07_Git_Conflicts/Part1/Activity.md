# Activity 7, Part 1: Merge

1. Part1Project.zip contains a git repository. Unzip it.
2. Inspect Part1Project.
    - Use `git branch` to list the branches in this repository.
    - Use `git checkout` to explore each branch.
    - Use `git log --all --graph` to explore the structure of commits.
3. Use `git diff COMMIT_OR_BRANCH` to view the changes since a commit or branch.
   Summarize what has changed on each branch.
4. Write a command sequence to merge the non-master branch into `master`
5. Execute your sequence and inspect the project again.
6. Did your merge sequence work as expected? How do you know?
