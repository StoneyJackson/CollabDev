# Activity 7, Part 2: Logical Conflicts

1. Part2Project.zip contains a git repository. Unzip it.
2. Explore the repository in Part2Project as you did in Part1.
3. Ensure that the code in each branch compiles.
4. View and summarize the changes that have been made on each branch.
5. Merge non-master branch into `master`.
6. Was git able to merge the branches?
7. Does the merged code compile? Do you foresee any problems?
8. From a developer point of view was the merger really successful?
9. Define a "logical merge conflict".
