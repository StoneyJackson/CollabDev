    if you own the copyrights to something, what can you do that no one else can do?
        ```





        ```
    - You find the code for a program published on a website. Without knowing
    anything else about it, can you...
        - View it?
            ```





            ```
        - Run it?
            ```





            ```
        - Post it on your site?
            ```

            ```





            ```
        - If you want to do something that would violate copyright, what must you do?

2. Watch the following video. Watch Now, UK. “Creative Commons & Copyright Info”. 2012. [https://youtu.be/8YkbeycRa2A](https://youtu.be/8YkbeycRa2A) This video explains the purpose of licenses from a content producer’s view who wants to let other use their work without having to ask permission. It specifically talks about the Creative Commons licenses.
3. Watch the following video. Intel Software. “Open Source Basics”. 2014. [https://youtu.be/Tyd0FO0tko8](https://youtu.be/Tyd0FO0tko8) . This video explains how open source software is enabled through licensing.
4. More questions:
    - What is a license? I.e., what is the purpose of a license?
        ```





        ```
    - When you license your program do you give up your copyright?
        ```





        ```
    - As the copyright holder, once you license your program, could you later license it under a different license?
        ```





        ```
    - If you relicense your program, can someone still use your program under the previous license?
        ```





        ```

4. Identify the license for the following projects:
    - [https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core)
        ```




        ```
    - [https://github.com/apache/incubator-fineract](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fineract)
        ```




        ```
    - [https://github.com/regulately/regulately-back-end](https://github.com/regulately/regulately-back-end)
