# Git - Undoing Changes

Sometimes you make changes to your files that you don't want to keep.
How you undo them when working with Git varies by what state your file
is in.

Content Learning Objectives
---------------------------

*After completing this activity, students should be able to:*

-   Undo changes to files in the working state.

-   Undo changes to files in the staged state.

-   Undo changes to files in the committed state.

Process Skill Goals
-------------------

*During the activity, students should make progress toward:*

-   Carefully reading Git command messages for understanding.
    (Information Processing)

Team Roles
----------

*Decide what role each of you will play for today. Choose a role that
you have not played before, or recently. The goal should be to have all
team members rotate through the roles on a regular basis to become
comfortable with all the roles. If you have only three people, one
should have two roles. If you have five people, two may share the same
role. Record role assignments here.*

| Role      | Name |
| --------- | ---- |
| Manager   |      |
| Presenter |      |
| Recorder  |      |
| Reflector |      |


Model 1: Undoing a change you made to a file.
=============================================

```bash
1  |  $ ls
   |  A.java
   |  
2  |  $ git log
   |  commit db967767f9ab675dba21e08c5d20627b34cbe133 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)
   |  Author: Karl R. Wurst <karl@w-sts.com>
   |  Date: Fri Jan 18 14:25:44 2019 -0500
   |  
   |      Add Feature X.
   |  
3  |  $ git status
   |  On branch master
   |  Nothing to commit, working tree clean
   |  
4  |  $ cat A.java
   |  This is change #1.
   |  
5  |  $ edit A.java
   |  
6  |  $ git status
   |  On branch master
   |  Changes not staged for commit:
   |    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
   |    (use "git checkout --<file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
   |  
   |          modified: A.java
   |  
   |  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
   |  
7  |  $ cat A.java
   |  This is modification #1.
   |  This is modification #2.
   |  
8  |  $ git checkout -- A.java
   |  
9  |  $ git status
   |  On branch master
   |  Nothing to commit, working tree clean
   |  
10 |  $ cat A.java
   |  This is change #1.
```

Questions (10 min)
------------------

1.  For command #1 through command #4, which of the three states
    (Working, Staging, Committed) is A.java in?

2.  What are the contents of A.java before command #5?

3.  For command 6 through command #7, which of the three states is
    A.java in?

4.  What are the contents of A.java between command #5 and command #8?

5.  What was the effect of the editing in command #5?

6.  After listing the contents of A.java in command #7, you decide that
    you didn't want to make those changes. What is the effect of
    command #8? Be sure your explanation refers to at least one of
    the three states.

7.  If you couldn't remember command #8, how could you figure out what
    command to give (without resorting to checking the Internet)?

8.  Describe a situation where you would find command #8 useful - and
    probably not possible to accomplish in any other way?

```


Questions (12 min)
------------------

1.  What is the effect of command #8?

2.  After issuing command #9, you decide that you do not want to commit
    your changes to A.java. What is the effect of command #10? Be
    sure your explanation refers to at least two of the three states.

3.  What does HEAD refer to in command #10? How did you figure that
    out?

4.  Explain why command #8 is a dangerous command. Or, at least, why
    you should always follow command #8 with command #9.

5.  If you couldn't remember command #10, how could you figure out what
    command to give (without resorting to checking the Internet)?

6.  Describe a situation where you would find command #10 useful?
