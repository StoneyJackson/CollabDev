Questions (10 min)
------------------

1.  What do you understand by Kanban?

> **Expected Answer \-\-- From first para of "What is Kanban?"**
>
> **Can the question be reframed as:**
>
> **What is Kanban? (Answer in 1 line from first para.)**

2.  What is a Kanban board?

3.  List the three-step workflow required in Kanban.

4.  List the benefits of Kanban.

> **Yes... only list them.... We can have additional following questions
> asking which benefit of Kanban does it represent:**
>
> **Which benefit of Kanban is represented by following situations:**

a.  **The product owner is free to reprioritize work in the backlog
    without disrupting the team, because any changes outside the current
    work items don\'t impact the team.**

    **Expected Answer: Planning Flexibility**

b.  **Teams employ basic best practices like code review and mentoring
    help to spread knowledge. Shared skills mean that team members can
    take on heterogeneous work.**

    **Expected Answer: Shortened Time Cycles**

c.  **A key tenant of kanban is to limit the amount of work in progress
    (WIP). A low limit encourages the team to pay special attention to
    issues in the review state, and to review others work before raising
    their own code reviews. This ultimately reduces the overall cycle
    time.**

    **Expected Answer: Fewer Bottlenecks**

d.  **Charts provide a visual mechanism for teams to ensure they\'re
    continuing to improve. Two common reports kanban teams use are
    control charts and cumulative flow diagrams.**

    **Expected Answer: Visual Metrics**

e.  **The faster a team can deliver innovation to market, the more
    competitive their product will be in the marketplace.**

    **Expected Answer: Continuous Delivery**

5.  Match the three-step workflows of Kanban with the lanes in Kanban
    **Game**.

> **Expected Answer:**

> **Done: Measure**

6.  Match the benefits of Kanban as listed in Step 4 for each of the
    following rounds of Kanban Game?

    f.  **Round 1**

> **Expected Answer: Planning Flexibility**

g.  **Round 2**

> **Expected Answer: **

c.  **Team Roles (Defined team roles in Scrum / No existing roles in
    Kanban).**

d.  **Release Methodology (At the end of each Sprint in Scrum /
    Continuous delivery at team's discretion).**

e.  **Key Metrics (Velocity in Scrum / Cycle Time in Kanban)**

f.  **Change Philosophy (During Sprint forecast or Sprint Story Time in
    Scrum / Change can happen anytime in Kanban)**

<!-- -->

3.  With reference to Step1, which similar activities or rules did you
    perform in both Kanban and Scrum Games?

> **Expected Answer: **

**Scrum Game:**

> **Expected Answer: **
>
> **The Sprint Cycle can be implemented with Kanban principles. Each
> User Story can work on Kanban principles with the tasks required to
> deliver a User Story prioritized on the Task Board. The Task Board can
> be treated as denoting the lanes for tasks: to do, doing and done.
> Each Task moves through these lanes on Kanban principles with limited
> Work in Progress. This ensures Continuous Delivery of tasks and hence
> user stories.**
