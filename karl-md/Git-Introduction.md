Git - Introduction

This activity is to reinforce and review Git basics. You have been using
GitLab as a repository manager for turning in your code in previous
classes. This activity offers to review the steps that have been
followed to do the same and refresh student’s knowledge.

Sharing Your Work Through GitLab

When you use GitLab as a way to share your work with your instructor and
your partner(s), you need to interact with the **gitlab.com** server.

  - Describe the process of submitting assignments through GitLab.

##  Process Skill Goals

## Team Roles

*Decide what role each of you will play for today. Choose a role that
you have not played before, or recently. The goal should be to have all
team members rotate through the roles on a regular basis to become
comfortable with all the roles. If you have only three people, one
should have two roles. If you have five people, two may share the same
role. Record role assignments here.*
