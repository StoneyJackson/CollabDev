Model 1: Traditional Grading Scheme
===================================

CS 100 is a hypothetical course in Computer Science.

It has two major learning objectives: Objective X and Objective Y. Both
have equal weight in the course, i.e. an equal amount of class and lab
time is spent on X and Y, and the assignments to assess the students\'
learning in X and Y are equally weighted in the course grading scheme
(each is worth 50% of the final grade.)

A letter grade of C is assigned for a 75% and is considered \"average\".

Questions (8 min)
-----------------

1.  Two students, Sarah and John, have taken CS 100. Sarah and John each
    > receive a final course grade of C in the course. What can you say
    > about Sarah and John\'s knowledge of the CS 100 material?

2.  What can you say about Sarah and John\'s knowledge about Objective
    > X? About Objective Y?

3.  Another student, Mike, has taken CS 100. Mike\'s scores on the
    > assignments to assess learning in Objective X is 50%, and in
    > Objective Y is 100%. What is Mike\'s final course grade for CS 100
    > (both percentage and letter)?

4.  What can you say about Mike\'s knowledge about Objective X? About
    > Objective Y?

5.  Would you consider Mike to be competent in the material for CS 100?

6.  How well does a traditional grading scheme (such as in the
    > hypothetical CS 100) represent a student\'s competence in the
    > course material?

Model 2: Specification- and Competence-based Grading Scheme
===========================================================

CS 100 is a hypothetical course in Computer Science. It has three major
learning objectives: Objective X, Objective Y, and Objective Z.

The instructor has developed a number of assignments that can be used to
assess the students\' learning in the course.

Each assignment includes a *specification* that lists all of the
conditions that must be met for a student's submission for that
assignment to be considered successfully completed.

The assignments and the learning objectives they address are as follows:

-   Assignments X1, X2, and X3 address Objective X.

    -   Successfully completing assignment X1 or X3 is sufficient to
        > show *competence* in Objective X.

    -   Successfully completing assignment X2 shows an *advanced
        > competence* in Objective X.

-   Assignments Y1, and Y2 address Objective Y.

    -   Successfully completing assignment Y1 is sufficient to show
        > competence in Objective Y.

    -   Successfully completing assignment Y2 shows *highly advanced
        > competence* in Objective Y.

-   Assignments Z1, Z2, Z3, and Z4 address Objective Z.

    -   Successfully completing assignment Z1, Z2, or Z4 is sufficient
        > to show competence in Objective Z.

    -   Successfully completing assignment Z3 shows an advanced
        > competence in Objective Z.

Questions (10 min)
------------------

1.  How would a student know what is required to \"successfully\"
    > complete a particular assignment?

2.  What are the possible grades that a student can earn on an
    > assignment?

3.  How will the instructor determine what grade the student has earned
    > on an assignment?

4.  Assuming that the instructor wants a course grade of C to show that
    > a student is minimally competent in all three learning objectives
    > for the course, list one possible set of assignments that a
    > student must successfully complete to receive a grade of C.

5.  Is that the only set of assignments that would satisfy the
    > instructor\'s requirements for a C?

6.  Given that a course grade of D is lower than a course grade of C,
    > and a course grade of F is a failing grade, suggest a set of
    > requirements for each?

7.  Given that a course grade of B is higher than a course grade of C,
    > and a course grade of A is the highest grade, suggest a set of
    > assignments that a student must successfully complete for a grade
    > of B, and another set of assignments that a student must
    > successfully complete for an A. (You may define each set in terms
    > of the course grade below it.)

8.  In Specification Grading, a higher grade is often described as being
    > earned by \"jumping over higher hurdles\" or \"jumping over more
    > hurdles.\" What do those two phrases mean in relation to the
    > example assignments listed in the model?
