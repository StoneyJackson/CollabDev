Model 1: Kanban
===============

introduction | Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban).

Questions (10 min)

1.  What is Kanban?

2.  What is a Kanban board?

3.  List the three-step workflow required in Kanban.

4.  List the benefits of Kanban.

5.  Which benefit of Kanban is represented by following situations:

    a.  The product owner is free to reprioritize work in the backlog without disrupting the team, because any changes outside the current work items don't impact the team.

    b.  Teams employ basic best practices like code review and mentoring help to spread knowledge. Shared skills mean that team members can take on heterogeneous work.

    c.  A key tenant of kanban is to limit the amount of work in progress (WIP). A low limit encourages the team to pay special attention to issues in the review state, and to review others work before raising their own code reviews. This ultimately reduces the overall cycle time.

    d.  Charts provide a visual mechanism for teams to ensure they're continuing to improve. Two common reports kanban teams use are control charts and cumulative flow diagrams.

    e.  The faster a team can deliver innovation to market, the more competitive their product will be in the marketplace.
