# Activity 11: Issue Trackers

## Part 1

1. Prepare to work on this project: [https://github.com/StoneyJackson/collaboration-temp](https://github.com/StoneyJackson/collaboration-temp)
    - Fork it
    - Clone your fork
    - Set upstream
2. Provide definitions for commands in study-guide.md, and upstream your contributions through pull-requests. Warning: you may encounter problems along the way, and your instructor may stop you before you are done. Document any problems you encountered below.
    ```











    ```
3. If you were unsuccessful, what might help you be more successful next time?
    ```











    ```
***STOP. Wait for your instructor before continuing***


## Part 2

1. Reset
    - Delete your fork and local repository from the previous part.
    - Your instructor will reset the project as follows.
        - Revert changes
        - Close outstanding PRs.
    - ***STOP. Wait for your instructor before continuing***
3. Help create issues for each term to be defined. One term per issue please. Avoid reporting issues that others have already reported.
4. Prepare to work on the project (fork and clone).
5. Now complete each issue as follows.
    - Find an issue that you did not report. Claim it by commenting on the issue, indicating you are working on it. Confirm that you were the first to claim it. If not, make a note of it in the issue tracker (e.g., "Never mind, Alice has it.") and look for another issue to work on.
    - Resolve the issue in your local repository, push it, make a pull-request. In your pull-request message body, make a note that it "resolves #x" where x is the issue number you are fixing.
    - Do not fix any other issues until your pull-request is accepted. You may have to resolve conflicts by synching with upstream, resolve conflicts locally and push your resolution (pull-request should automatically update).
    - Try to fix at least one more issue.
6. Document below any problems you encountered
    ```
